Which AI tools did you try?
I have used all three of Github Copilot, ChatGPT and Claude.ai

What worked well? What didn’t?
I think ChatGPT worked the best for overall task management - starting from scratch to debugging. However, Claude.ai provides code that are 1000+ lines long which is not always necessary. Github Copilot seemed to have been efficient in smaller tasks.

When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
To brainstorm ideas or look for possible solutions when stuck.
