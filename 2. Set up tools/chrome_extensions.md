Which extensions did you install? Why?
I installed React Developer Tools to inspect React component trees, check props/state, and debug rendering behaviour. It makes frontend debugging much easier compared to using the standard DevTools alone.
I also installed Redux DevTools to help me track Redux store changes in real time, view dispatched actions, inspect previous vs next state, and replay state transitions. It is essential when working on apps that use Redux for global state management.

What was the most useful thing you learned?
Learning how powerful Redux DevTools is for debugging state issues. Seeing each action, its payload, and how it changes the state step-by-step makes it much easier to find bugs in complex apps.
