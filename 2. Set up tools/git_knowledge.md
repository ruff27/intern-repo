Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
I have used Git multiple times during my university days where I had to collaborate in group projects.
I used it to manage code versions, merge code, use branches, and push projects to Github.

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I used Github Desktop app as it was great for visualising commits, branches and history. It was good for quick, UI-based staging and committing.
I also used Git in VSCode which helps me integrate into my editor. It works seamlessly with the terminal inside VS Code.

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
The most interesting thing I learned about Git today is how staging works - being able to commit exactly what you want to publish gives you more control on how clean and organised the commit history looks.
