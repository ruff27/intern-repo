Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I used Windows Terminal with Powershell as it is fast and modern. The user interface is quite simple and also allows multiple tabs. I have previously used it to run front-end and backend directories that ensured everything is running smoothly.

What customizations (if any) did you make?
No customisation required.

What was the most useful command you learned today?
mkdir to initialise folders
