📌 Setting Up Docker and Docker Compose
🎯 Goal
Install Docker and Docker Compose and learn basic commands to manage containers.

✅ Why is this important?
Focus Bear’s backend relies on Docker Compose to manage services like PostgreSQL, Redis, and the NestJS API. Understanding how to install and use Docker is essential for running the backend locally.

✅ Tasks

Research how to install Docker and Docker Compose (if not installed)

Verify Docker installation and check running services

Learn key Docker commands (docker ps, docker stop, docker logs, etc.)

Explore how Docker Compose simplifies multi-container setups
✅ Reflection (docker-setup.md)
What is the difference between docker run and docker-compose up?
How does Docker Compose help when working with multiple services?
What commands can you use to check logs from a running container?
What happens when you restart a container? Does data persist?
