
Research the importance of unit testing in software development.

Choose a testing framework (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, PyTest for Python).

Write a few unit tests for a function in your test repo.

Write reflections in clean_code.md:
How do unit tests help keep code clean?
Unit tests help keep the code clean by directing developer to code that are predictable, modular and easy to understand. While running a test, it is crucial to clearly define what each function is supposed to do.
It also acts as a safety net helping developers identify mistakes when a test is failed. This encourages cleaner architecture.

What issues did you find while testing?
I did not have any particular issue as it easily identified data type error where I placed alphabet 'a' instead of a numerical value which led for this particular test case to fail.
