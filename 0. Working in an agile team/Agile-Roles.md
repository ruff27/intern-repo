- [ ] My role in the Agile is developer which involves following up with stand-ups, working on new issues and maintaining the workflow. 
- [ ] How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
- [ ] My work will be closely followed by the QA who will do the tests and provide feedback based on the tasks I solve. I will also invovle the Agile PM to stay in track of project backlogs/sprints.

#### 🛠️ Task  
- [ ] Write a short description of how your **role fits into the Agile team**.
- [ ] My role as a developer is foundational to agile process. I will be participating in planning sessions by engaging in daily stand-ups as well as collaborating with co-developers to build quality solutions for customers and adapt to feedback.
- [ ] Identify one **other role** you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
- [ ] I will be involving with Product Manager by working on product backlog as well as initiating technical discussions that involves looking over strategies, technical constraints, and priorite what is feasible and efficient.

During my BanglaGhar real estate project, I collaborated closely with a teammate who reviewed my pull requests and acted as an informal QA. One time they pointed out a bug with form validation that I had completely missed, and fixing it early saved us from breaking the sign-up flow. This showed me how valuable QA collaboration is and how early feedback leads to better-quality releases.

To improve collaboration with QA, I plan to do a quick check-in after completing each feature so we can align on expected behaviour and reduce misunderstandings.
