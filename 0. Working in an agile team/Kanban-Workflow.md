How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
On a Kanban board, work is visualised by organised columns that represent each stage of work. Common column names include "to-do", "in-progress", and "done".
A team moves through columns by each task. Kanban board improves workflow by visual cards where team can see what is required to do which allows them to address specific issues.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
Backlog is for tasks are to be completed or any requirements that are yet to be initialised.
In progress is for tasks that are currently being solved by a team. They can be sub-divided into specific progresss such as developing, testing, or verifying.
Blocked is for tasks that cannot go ahead due to external issues, technical issues, or missing documentation.
Done represents the tasks that are fully completed which lets the team to move ahead to next task.

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
When a team members works on the task, they can change the status of the task to the respective column (such was in-progress to done).
Usually it is the individual assigned to the specific task who is responsible for updating them.

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Prevents team from multi-tasking, thus ensuring smooth and efficient completion of tasks.
Tasks are completed much quicker by focusing on existing work.
Ensures team is not burned out by too much work ensuring work quality.

📝 Reflection

How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
The visual pull system allows to help manage priorities. The highest priority tasks are placed at the top of to-do list. WIP prevents team from taking another task before finishing the existing one first. This makes the workflow more sustainable.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve workflow by making explicit policies so that everyone in the team understands how the work is done and what needs to be followed. For example, I can mention the code is not ready for code review yet before QA check is completed.

Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

Moved from superlow priority to QA done.

Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
I can add a comment to the card explaining what has been done and clarify what sort of QA testing has been completed.
