📌 Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks
🔍 Research & Learn

What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is a dynamic, iterative approach to project management allows to focus on continuous development, flexibility, and collaboration with team.
In contrast, traditional project management is a linear and sequential approach that strictly follows certain steps must be completed before moving on to the next one.

What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
Main objective is to satisfy customer needs through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Be welcoming to changes even late in development to meet competitive landscape.
Team should regularly reflect on how to be more effective and adjust its approach accordingly.

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
Scrum is iterative as the team works in sprints follows the plan-do-check-act. Scrum has specific roles defined such as product owner, scrum master, development team.
Kanban is continuous development. Team moves to next task as soon as one gets done. There are no specific roles for kanban.

Scrum should be used with projects that have clear goals defined and have predictable deliverable dates. 
While Kanban is suited for ongoing-work or maintenence work where the goal is to complete tasks as they rise.

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear already has their project set up which means it does not require sprint planning. Focus Bear is more about maintaining the workflow and work through issues as they rise.

📝 Reflection

What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The benefits would include adaptability, improved customer satisfaction, risk mitigation and continuous improvement.
Challenges would be lack of upfront predictability, potential for lack of documentation, and understanding complex practices to be successful in organisations.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Better risk mitigation by breaking down smaller iterations and regularly reviewing progress.
Continuous improvement by evaluating processess, identifying issues, and implement small but effective changes.
Flexibility which allows to adapt to change when required.

🛠️ Task

Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

Scrum allows to learn through sprints with a predictable deadline in mind while in Kanban, deliverables are processed continuously on need-based basis.
Changes in scrum are generally discouraged while in Kanban changes are welcome allowing iterations and continous development.

Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
Collaboration as this will let team to share ideas between themselves and provide best possible delivery for customers by coming to a conclusion.

During my BanglaGhar real estate project, I naturally followed a Kanban-style workflow. 
I used a board to manage tasks, picked up new items only after completing the previous one, 
and frequently made small adjustments based on feedback. This helped reduce bugs and improved 
feature delivery. I plan to apply the same method at Focus Bear by breaking backend tasks into 
smaller units and updating progress continuously.
