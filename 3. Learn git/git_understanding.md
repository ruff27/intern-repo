
Make three commits in your repo with different commit message styles:
A vague commit message (e.g., "fixed stuff").
Fixed stuff

An overly detailed commit message.
"Went through the open-source projects and wrote a new commit message for this repo"

A well-structured commit message.
"Updated with a well-structured commit message (#45)" (in the screenshot it says 1 instead of 45)

Write reflections in git_understanding.md:

What makes a good commit message
Clear and concise subject line. For example: "Fix: Updated newsletter button to redirect to email" instead of "fixed newsletter"
Making reference to issue ID.
Having a detailed body.


How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?
A clear commit message helps collaborators to refer to the issues, understand the context of the problem solved, refer back to the commit history of further changes are to be made.

How can poor commit messages cause issues later?
It may make it harder to understand why the change was made thus making it difficult to debug.
Poorly written messages also cause delays in development procedure as time is wasted to look for context.

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
Completed.
