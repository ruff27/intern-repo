
Make three commits in your repo with different commit message styles:
A vague commit message (e.g., "fixed stuff").
Fixed stuff

An overly detailed commit message.
A well-structured commit message.

Write reflections in git_understanding.md:
What makes a good commit message?
How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?
How can poor commit messages cause issues later?

Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
