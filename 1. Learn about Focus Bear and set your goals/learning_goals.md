What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I want to gain practical industry-level backend development experience that goes beyond university projects. Specifically, I hope to learn how a real production system is structured, how different services communicate, and how the backend is maintained, monitored, and deployed. I’ve mostly worked on academic and personal projects, so experiencing a real engineering workflow—such as code reviews, debugging real user issues, and following internal standards—is something I’m excited to learn and apply in my future career.

What skills are you most excited to develop?
I’m most excited to strengthen my backend engineering skills, especially in the areas of Node.js, server-side logic, API development, and database design.
During my capstone project I worked lightly on Express routes and MongoDB queries, but I always felt there was more depth to understand especially regarding security, scalability, testing, and performance. I want to become someone who can confidently build and maintain backend features, and this internship feels like the perfect place to develop those skills with real guidance and feedback.

What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
One area I want to improve is visualising problems using diagrams and structured planning.
During my capstone project, we once misinterpreted how the data should flow from the listing form to the backend because we didn’t create a proper sequence diagram. We had to redo a portion of the workflow, which taught me how important clear visual planning can be.
I’d like to get better at using tools like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and architecture sketches to understand problems more clearly before writing code.

What does success in this internship look like for you?
Completing multiple backend-related tasks independently
Applying feedback from code reviews and visibly improving over time
Becoming more confident in backend architecture and debugging
Contributing to features or fixes that genuinely help the team
Showing consistent growth through documentation, communication, and problem-solving
